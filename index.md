Hello world! :wave:

I'm an undergraduate student researcher at [McMaster University](https://www.mcmaster.ca/) in Hamilton, Ontario studying the impact of 'Zoom Fatigue' on the enjoyment and effectiveness of virtual group work under the supervision of [Dr. Mayu Nishimura](https://science.mcmaster.ca/pnb/component/comprofiler/userprofile/nishimm.html?Itemid=351) in the department of [Psychology, Neuroscience & Behaviour](https://science.mcmaster.ca/pnb/).

I am also a Community Program Analyst for the [City of Hamilton](https://www.hamilton.ca/) and a Program Support Assistant for the [MacPherson Institute](https://mi.mcmaster.ca/) at McMaster University. 

In the past I have worked as a media designer for the [Department of Chemical Engineering](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/chemeng), a research assistant for the [Education and Cognition lab](https://edcog.ca/), and a counselor for the [Lieutenant Governor's Indigenous Summer Reading Camp](https://www.frontiercollege.ca/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=45baf21f-f213-45a5-8396-c24a27413ce7).

I'm interested in the intersection of technology, mental health, and social media.
